# SLSharp
Interop Library for Nvidia Streamline for .NET applications.

## NOTE
The API is currently incomplete, it only contains most of the base Streamline API and the API for DLSS/DLAA. 
Because of this, the library is only available in source form currently.

## Disclaimer
This project is NOT an official Nividia project and/or product. If you are looking for the official Nvidia Streamline SDK, it can be found [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/Streamline).
